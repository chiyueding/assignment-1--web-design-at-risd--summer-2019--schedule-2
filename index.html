   <blockquote cite=https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1587399>
   When you study art history, you learn that there is very little that is completely new, and in many ways digital art is no different. I love to derive inspiration from all types of images: mosaics, hieroglyphics, petroglyphs, woven patterns in textiles, and needlework. There is a lot of very good pixel design work before the 20th century, like a 1760 sampler by Elizabeth Laidman that looks like a bitmap font.</blockquote>
